<h4>Upcoming in the Bahamas</h4>
<p>Intrigue, Passion and unpredicyability make mixed 4X400M relay a crowd favourite.
<br>
After a raucous debut at the IAAF world relays Earlier this year, track star steven Gardiner<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gardiner"><img src="gardinergold.jpg" width="500"></a> predicts dancing in the steets fo the bahamas when the mixed 4X400M relays Athletes line us at the starting blocks at the<a href="https://www.olympic.org/tokyo-2020">olympic games Tokyo 2020</a> </p>
<br>
<p>“It’s going to be awesome because most of the countries are small and don’t have a full relay team, so the mixed relay will give a lot of other countries a chance to win a medal at the Olympics,” the 21-year-old steven Gardiner said, adding with a grin, “like The Bahamas.”

	<br>
	“It was one of the best atmospheres, the crowd was awesome. Everybody was so excited,” laughed Gardiner.
<br>
After soaking up the vibe in his home stadium and celebrating with teammates he’s barely ever had the opportunity to race with, you can understand why Gardiner thinks adding the event to the Tokyo 2020 programme is a “great idea”.
<br>
<br>
The Bahamian team is a good example of the type of NOC that will hope to benefit from the event’s Olympic debut. While the Caribbean nation boasts a top-class men’s 4x400m team, which claimed bronze at the Olympic Games Rio 2016, the women’s squad failed to make the final in Rio de Janeiro last summer. Put the two squads together, however, and you have genuine gold medal contenders.
<br>
It is no wonder Gardiner, who set a new national 400m record of 44.26 seconds earlier this season, is “very excited” at the prospect.
