	<h2 align="center">Cuba</h2>
	<br><br>
	<p>over the last 30 years cuba has won 56 gold medals, they participated in relay, marathon, long jump, tripple jump, discus throw, baseball, basketball, boxing, canoeing, cycling, fencing, judo, rowing, swimming, water polo, weight lifting, wrestling and alot more in which they won medals even gold. </p><br>
	<p>In boxing and wrestling they won alot of gold and silver medals.</p>
	<p>Mijaín López<img src="Mijaín.jpg" width="600">Cuban wrestler who won three consecutive Greco-Roman wrestling gold medals at the Olympic Games (2008, 2012, and 2016). López began wrestling when he was 10 years old.Unbeaten at the Olympic Games since Beijing 2008. He is also a five-time world champion and one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.
		<br>
	 López was nicknamed “the Kid” as an ironic nod to his incredible size and “the Terrible” in reference to his competitive nature on the wrestling mat. At his first major competition, the 2002 world championships, López finished 13th in 120-kg Greco-Roman competition. He placed 16th at the 2003 worlds but went on to achieve great success in the years that followed. He took the world title in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010 and finished with the silver medal in 2006 and 2011. Troubled by a thigh injury, he saw his bid for a third straight gold medal stopped by Turkey’s Riza Kayaalp in the 2011 final. López was also an eight-time winner at the Pan American Championships and took the gold medal at the Pan American Games in 2003, 2007, and 2011. He was named Cuba’s top athlete in 2007 and 2010.

Between 2004 and 2012, López finished outside the top three in a major international event only once—when he placed fifth in his Olympic debut at the 2004 Games in Athens. At the 2008 Games in Beijing, he captured his first Olympic gold medal. He defended his title at the 2012 London Games. With that win, he joined Aleksandr Karelin and Aleksandr Kolchinsky as the third wrestler to win multiple Olympic gold medals at 120 kg. He moved up to the 130-kg weight class at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, where he won a third consecutive Olympic gold medal.

</p>
	<br>
	<p>López was given the honour of carrying his country’s flag at the Beijing 2008 Opening Ceremony <img src="mijainflag.jpg" width="500" height="300"> he was also the Flagbearer for  Cuba in london 2012 and Rio de Janeiro 2016. When asked which medal he was aiming to win at the Games, he smiled and left the Cuban wrestling team’s head coach Pedro Val to do the talking: “The gold medal of course. No doubt about it. Only the gold will do.”</p>
	<br>
	<p>outside of the olympics López has about 28gold medals.
	As part of his strategy, Lopez was absent from the competition in Nur-Sultán, with the aim of regathering his strength to ensure optimal conditions for the Tokyo 2020 Games.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h3>Upcomming</h3>
	<br>
	<p>Cuba has so far classified 26 athletes who will participate in 34 of the tests of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.
		<br>
	Cuba aspires to participate in the Tokyo meeting with a delegation of 120 athletes who will participate in some 18 sports, according to the High Performance Director of the Sports Institute, José Antonio Miranda.
To that end, he indicated that there is already a pre-selection of 343 athletes from which the Cuban representation will come out in the next Olympics, to which the island goes with the pretense of being among the top 20 countries.
<br>
Among the classifieds are the champion of Greco-Roman wrestling Mijaín López, who will look in the Japanese capital for his fourth Olympic scepter, and the young specialist in launching the album, Yaimé Pérez, who goes for his first crown in these Games.
<br>
The 34 disciplines with classified Cuban athletes are athletics (10), canoeing (4), cycling (1), artistic gymnastics (2), wrestling (2), modern pentathlon (2) and shooting (5), explained the manager.
<br>
Miranda said that the number of 26 classifieds should grow from January to May with sports of ranks and brands such as athletics, badminton, judo, swimming, triathlon, beach volleyball and weightlifting.
<br><br>
According to Inder assessments, Cuba has achieved the best results in international competitions in sports such as wrestling, weights, judo, canoeing, beach volleyball, table tennis, badminton, triathlon and fencing.

The island competed in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games with a delegation of 123 athletes in 19 disciplines and their athletes won 11 medals, of which 5 were gold, 2 silver and 4 bronze.</p>

	<p>
Fifty-six years after having organised the Olympic Games, the Japanese capital will be hosting a Summer edition for the second time, from 24 July to 9 August 2020. The Games in 1964 radically transformed the country. According to the organisers of the event in 2020, the Games of the XXXII Olympiad of the modern era will be “the most innovative ever organised, and will rest on three fundamental principles to transform the world: striving for your personal best (achieving your personal best); accepting one another (unity in diversity); and passing on a legacy for the future (connecting to tomorrow)”.

Aligning with the reforms advocated by Olympic Agenda 2020, the Tokyo Games will use as many existing competition venues as possible, namely those built for the Games in 1964, such as the prestigious Nippon Budokkan for judo, the Baji Koen Park for equestrian events, and the Yoyogi National Gymnasium for handball. The Tokyo National Stadium, where the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and athletics competitions will be staged, will be completely revamped and replaced by a new arena.

Japan has been an Olympic land since the Summer Games of 1964, which were the first to be staged in Asia. In 2020, the country will host its fourth Games, if we include the Winter Games of 1972 in Sapporo and of 1998 in Nagano.

	<p>Sprint:
		<br>
	Races over short distances or sprints are among the oldest running competitions.The 100m sprint race has been included at the Summer Olympic Games since the first Games in 1896 for men and since 1928 for women. The 100m race is one of the most historical races along with the marathon. Introduced to the Olympic Games in 1896 for the first modern Olympiad (held in Athens, Greece). Thomas Burke (USA) won the first-ever 100-meter dash in 12.0 seconds at the 1896 Games in Athens.
	<br><br>
	Relay:
	<br>
	Though the concept can be traced to Ancient Greece, where a 'message stick' was delivered via a series of couriers, modern relays emulate the charity races organised by the New York fire service in the 1880s, in which red pennants were handed over every 300 yards.
	The first Olympic relay took place in 1908 – but was split into two legs of 200m, followed by one of 400m and another of 800m. The first Olympic 4x100m relay for men was held in 1912; the first for women was held in 1928.

 <br>
 <p>Jamaica has mostly execelled in the 100m, 200m and 4×100m relay</p>
 <p>usain bolt(dubbed the fastest man alive)<img src="usainmedal.png"  width="400"> He is a world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 × 100 metres relay. Owing to his achievements and dominance in sprint competition, he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time,
 An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016). In addition he won two 4 × 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which made him the first person to hold both records since fully automatic time became mandatory. Bolt improved upon his second 100 m world record of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 – the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the 200 metres world record, setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three 4 × 100 metres relay world records, with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles. At the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, Bolt ran the 100-meter and 200-meter events. In the 100-meter final leading up to the Games, when he broke the world record, winning in 9.69 seconds. Not only was the record set without a favorable wind, but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished (and his shoelace was untied), an act that aroused much controversy later on.Bolts rival was An American runner and rival Justin Gatlin.
 <br><br>
 "This is why I came here, to the Olympics, to prove to the world that I’m the best — again,” he told reporters at a news conference. “It always feels good to go out on top, you know what I mean?”

He continued his Olympic winning streak, taking gold in the 200-meter in 19.78 seconds. "What else can I do to prove I am the greatest?" Bolt said in an interview with BBC Sport. ”I'm trying to be one of the greatest, to be among [Muhammad] Ali and Pele. I have made the sport exciting, I have made people want to see the sport. I have put the sport on a different level."

The "fastest man alive" remained undefeated in what he said would be the last race of his Olympic career, the 4x100-meter relay which he ran with teammates Asafa Powell, Yohan Blake and Nickel Ashmeade. Anchoring the race, Bolt led the Jamaican team to win gold, crossing the finish line in 37.27. Japan won silver and Canada took the bronze. It was the third consecutive gold medal win for Bolt in Rio. He ended his legendary Olympic career acknowledging the support of his fans on Twitter.

In an interview with CBS News, Bolt detailed his pride over his 2012 performance: "It's what I came here to do. I'm now a legend. I'm also the greatest athlete to live. I've got nothing left to prove."
<br><br>
In 2017, Bolt faced challenges on the track at the World Athletics Championships. He finished third in the men's 100 meters, taking home the bronze medal behind Christian Coleman, who won silver, and Justin Gatlin, who took home the gold. It was the first time that Bolt had been beaten at a World Athletic Championships since 2007. His struggles didn't end there: in the 4x100-meter relay, which many believed would be Bolt's final race, <img src="boltinjury.jpg" width="300"> he collapsed from a hamstring injury and had to cross the finish line with the help of his teammates.
In August 2017, following the World Athletic Championships, Bolt announced his retirement from track and field. “For me I don’t think one championship is going to change what I’ve done,” he said at a press conference. “I personally won’t be one of those persons to come back.”
<br><br>
<h4>Soccer Career</h4>
<img src="boltballa.jpg">
Usain Bolt had long talked about eventually making a career in soccer. In August 2017, following his retirement from track and field, he planned to join Manchester United for a charity game against Barcelona, but he had to miss the match due to his hamstring injury. In September, Bolt said he was already in talks with several pro soccer teams, including Manchester United. “We have a lot of offers from different teams, but I have to get over my injury first and then take it from there,” he told reporters.

In October, Bolt reaffirmed his commitment to playing soccer. "For me it's a personal goal. I don't care what people really think about it. I'm not going to lie to myself. I'm not going to be stupid," he told reporters at the U.S. Formula One Grand Prix. "If I go out there and feel I can do this then I will give it a try. It's a dream and another chapter of my life. If you have a dream that you always wanted to do, why not try and see where it will go."
<p>
	<br><br>
	<h3>Upcomming</h3>
	<p>2016 may not be Usain Bolt’s final Olympic campaign after all.
<br><br>
In a Sunday interview with the Jamaican network 1Spot Media, the world’s fastest man said that his coach Glen Mills believes Bolt could compete in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. 
<br><
“Coach said I can go on to even the next Olympics in 2020. I’m not going to say what I’m going to do, but my coaches say I should stop talking about retirement," Bolt said. 
<br>
The 29-year-old announced last February that 2017 was likely to be his final season, but yesterday the mighty Jamaican said that if he’s still competing at his best, he’d be up for a fifth Olympic appearance.
<br>
“If I feel I can do it, I’ll definitely try. But for me, I want to retire on top of my game.”
<br>
Even despite injury concerns throughout the early part of last summer, Bolt retained his spot atop the sprinting world by beating out American Justin Gatlin for 100m and 200m gold at the World Championships while also anchoring the Jamaicans to 4x100m glory.</p>

	<h2 align="center">Trinidad and Tobago</h2>
	<p><p><a href="history.html">A breif history of the track</a></p>
	<p>Trinidad and tobago is one of the countries that have participated in the olympics over the last 30 years.<img src="trinidad.jpg" width="500">they have participated in various track and field events some witch are 100, 200 and 400 meter sprints, relays, boxing,cycling,sailing,swimming,badmintion,table tennis, long jump, marathon, taekwondo, shooting and gymnastics they participate in many events even if they did not win medals for all events they still participated.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Trinidad mostly excel in Athletics</p>
	<br>
	<p>Emmanuel Callender<img src="emmanuel1.jpg" width="600">2008 olympic games 4×100 m relay Gold Medalist, 2012 Olympic Games 4X100M Silver Medalist and 2008 Olympic Games 4X100m relay Silver Medalist and</p>
	<p>According to newsday.co National sprinter and double Olympic medallist Emmanuel Callender is concerned over the future of (TT) track and field and is holding the authorities accountable for the state of the sport locally. In an interview callender was asked about his plans for 2019 and he replied: "My plan for the 2019 season is to try to win every race. That is why we train hard most of the year, for a race that takes a few seconds. The reality is somebody will beat you at some point, even (Usain) Bolt, so it’s not just about winning, it’s how you compete to win. In order to achieve this, I look at off-the-track responsibilities as well as government, sponsors, fans and persons needing inspirations. I will use this momentum, of this year, to compete at next year’s Japan Olympics where I plan to retire". 
		<br>
	Another question was:How do you see the future of (TT) trinidad and tobago track and field, especially sprinting? Who are the ones you see taking over when you step aside?and he replied
<br>
"First of all, the future has never been bright from the get-go. The history would show how athletes struggled to get somewhere, before and after the sport. ‘The sky is the limit’ does not apply to TT. Some people do their best to keep the sky dark and ride the bandwagon of one star, when he/she emerges. They are not concerned (about) other developing stars. It is a fact, I know what I’m saying. I speak to a lot of athletes, or a lot of athletes come to speak to me.

The younger athletes’ mentality is to perpetuate this cycle of hatred by helping to tear down aspirations of others who are doing well, just to be the one star. Look at what’s happening with crime. It’s the same thing with sport. Look at how may sporting bodies right now are in court. That speaks for itself. How do I see the future of track and field? It’s not looking like a good one. I think there needs to be a lot of changes, I believe, at the administrative level.

I think that there are some people who just really are not concerned about you. They speak it but they’re not really manifesting what they are speaking about. I came into the sport, hoping to be a change and an inspiration to others, by the gift that God has given me. I know, in life, there are struggles you would face, but when you see your own trying to tear you down, that is something (else). It’s just really sad".

<h3>Upcomming</h3>
<br>
<p>With the trinidad and tobago flag waving and her parents cheering at the finish line, Abigail Viera made History by becoming the first Athlete from the Dual-island Caribbean netion to compete at a winter youth Olympic Games.
<br><br>
The 17-year-old Alpine skier was born in the United States but chose to represent her parents’ homeland at Lausanne 2020.
A day after serving as Trinidad and Tobago’s flagbearer in the Opening Ceremony, Vieira competed in the women’s Super-G at Les Diablerets, the first medal event at Lausanne 2020.

She placed 42nd out of 62 competitors, finishing in 1 minute, 2.58 seconds. But neither the time nor the result mattered: representing the nation on the global stage was what counted most.

<h4>Upcoming in the Bahamas</h4>
<p>Intrigue, Passion and unpredicyability make mixed 4X400M relay a crowd favourite.
<br>
After a raucous debut at the IAAF world relays Earlier this year, track star steven Gardiner<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gardiner"><img src="gardinergold.jpg" width="500"></a> predicts dancing in the steets fo the bahamas when the mixed 4X400M relays Athletes line us at the starting blocks at the<a href="https://www.olympic.org/tokyo-2020">olympic games Tokyo 2020</a> </p>
<br>
<p>“It’s going to be awesome because most of the countries are small and don’t have a full relay team, so the mixed relay will give a lot of other countries a chance to win a medal at the Olympics,” the 21-year-old steven Gardiner said, adding with a grin, “like The Bahamas.”
	<br>
	<img src="mixed.jpg" width="600">
	<br>
	“It was one of the best atmospheres, the crowd was awesome. Everybody was so excited,” laughed Gardiner.
<br>
After soaking up the vibe in his home stadium and celebrating with teammates he’s barely ever had the opportunity to race with, you can understand why Gardiner thinks adding the event to the Tokyo 2020 programme is a “great idea”.
<br>
<br>
The Bahamian team is a good example of the type of NOC that will hope to benefit from the event’s Olympic debut. While the Caribbean nation boasts a top-class men’s 4x400m team, which claimed bronze at the Olympic Games Rio 2016, the women’s squad failed to make the final in Rio de Janeiro last summer. Put the two squads together, however, and you have genuine gold medal contenders.
<br>
It is no wonder Gardiner, who set a new national 400m record of 44.26 seconds earlier this season, is “very excited” at the prospect.
