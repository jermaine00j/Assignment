	<p>Mijaín López<img src="Mijaín.jpg" width="600">Cuban wrestler who won three consecutive Greco-Roman wrestling gold medals at the Olympic Games (2008, 2012, and 2016). López began wrestling when he was 10 years old.Unbeaten at the Olympic Games since Beijing 2008. He is also a five-time world champion and one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.
		<br>
	 López was nicknamed “the Kid” as an ironic nod to his incredible size and “the Terrible” in reference to his competitive nature on the wrestling mat. At his first major competition, the 2002 world championships, López finished 13th in 120-kg Greco-Roman competition. He placed 16th at the 2003 worlds but went on to achieve great success in the years that followed. He took the world title in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010 and finished with the silver medal in 2006 and 2011. Troubled by a thigh injury, he saw his bid for a third straight gold medal stopped by Turkey’s Riza Kayaalp in the 2011 final. López was also an eight-time winner at the Pan American Championships and took the gold medal at the Pan American Games in 2003, 2007, and 2011. He was named Cuba’s top athlete in 2007 and 2010.

Between 2004 and 2012, López finished outside the top three in a major international event only once—when he placed fifth in his Olympic debut at the 2004 Games in Athens. At the 2008 Games in Beijing, he captured his first Olympic gold medal. He defended his title at the 2012 London Games. With that win, he joined Aleksandr Karelin and Aleksandr Kolchinsky as the third wrestler to win multiple Olympic gold medals at 120 kg. He moved up to the 130-kg weight class at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, where he won a third consecutive Olympic gold medal.

</p>
	<br>
	<p>López was given the honour of carrying his country’s flag at the Beijing 2008 Opening Ceremony <img src="mijainflag.jpg" width="500" height="300"> he was also the Flagbearer for  Cuba in london 2012 and Rio de Janeiro 2016. When asked which medal he was aiming to win at the Games, he smiled and left the Cuban wrestling team’s head coach Pedro Val to do the talking: “The gold medal of course. No doubt about it. Only the gold will do.”</p>
	<br>
	<p>outside of the olympics López has about 28gold medals.
	As part of his strategy, Lopez was absent from the competition in Nur-Sultán, with the aim of regathering his strength to ensure optimal conditions for the Tokyo 2020 Games.</p>
	<br><br>
